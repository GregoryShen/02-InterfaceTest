## [Installing and Updating](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/installation-and-updates/)

Postman is available on the web at [go.postman.co/home](https://go.postman.co/home) and as a native desktop app for Mac(Intel and M1), Windows (32-bit/64-bit), and Linux (64-bit) operating systems.

To get the latest version of the Postman desktop app, visit the download page and select Download for your platform.

### Installing Postman on the desktop

#### Mac

Postman is available for macOS 10.11(EI Capitan) and later.

1. Download the latest Postman app.

   Make sure to download the Mac Apple Chip version if you have a Mac with the M1 processor.

2. If your browser downloads the file as a ZIP file, find the file in the Downloads folder and unzip it.

3. In the Downloads folders, double-click the Postman file to install it.

4. When prompted, move the file to your Applications folder. This will ensure that future updates can be installed correctly.

You may encounter a "Library not loaded" error if you unzip and install Postman using a third-party archiving app. Use the default Archive Utility for Mac to unzip the file.

You can also install Postman using the Homebrew package manager:

```shell
brew install --cask postman
```

#### Windows

Postman is available for Windows 7 and later.

1. Download the latest Postman app.
2. Select and run the `.exe` file to install Postman.

Postman v9.4 is the latest version of the Postman app that supports both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows. All versions of the Postman app following v9.4 will only work on 64-bit Windows. You can continue to use Postman v9.4 and earlier on 32-bit Windows.

#### Linux

You can install Postman on Linux by manually downloading it, using the [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/postman) store link, or with the command `snap install postman`.

To install manually, download and unzip the app, for example into the `Downloads` directory.

To start the app from a launcher icon, create a desktop file, naming it `Postman.desktop` and saving it in the following location:

```bash
~/.local/share/applications/Postman.desktop
```

Enter the following content in the file, replacing `/path/to/Downloads` with the location of the file, and save it.

```shell
[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=Postman
Exec=/path/to/Downloads/Postman/app/Postman %U
Icon=/path/to/Downloads/Postman/app/resources/app/assets/icon.png
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=Development;
```

Postman supports the following distributions:

* Ubuntu 14.04 and newer
* Fedora 24
* Debian 8 and newer

The support of certain Linux distributions depends on if they're supported by Electron. Refer to [Electron's documentation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/support#linux).

It's recommended you install Snap as it includes all the libraries that the app needs and they're bundled with the app itself.

Avoid starting Postman using the `sudo` command, as it will create permission issues on the files created by Postman.

Make sure you have read/write permission for the `~/.config` folder where Postman stores information.

If you are an Ubuntu 18 user, you will also need to install the `ligbconf-2-4` package with the command `apt-get install libgconf-2-4`

### Using Postman on the web

You can use Postman in your web browser to carry out your API development and testing tasks in conjunction with the Postman Agent. To access Postman for Web, visit go.postman.co/home. 

#### Browser requirements

Postman for Web is optimized for the following browsers:

* Chrome(78 and higher)
* Firefox(76 and higher)
* Edge(70 and higher)
* Safari(13.1.1 and higher)

#### Installing the Postman desktop agent

If you are using the Postman for Web, you also need to download the Postman desktop agent, a micro-application that runs locally on your desktop. The desktop agent overcomes the Cross Object Resources Sharing(CORS) limitations of browsers and acts as your agent for making API calls from Postman for Web.

You will be prompted to download and install the desktop agent so that you can make requests from Postman for Web. You can also download the agent directly from the Postman Agent page. Once you have the desktop agent installed you will be able to use it with web requests.

To learn more about the desktop agent, read the [Introducing the Postman Agent](https://blog.postman.com/introducing-the-postman-agent-send-api-requests-from-your-browser-without-limits/) blog post.

#### Selecting the agent for requests

From Postman for Web, you can select the agent you would like to use for your requests:

* <u>Auto-select</u>: Postman automatically selects the best agent to use for your request.
* <u>Cloud</u>: Manually select this option to send HTTP requests using Postman's cloud servers.
* <u>Desktop</u>: Manually select this option to send requests using the Postman desktop agent.
* <u>Browser</u>: Manually select this option to send requests using your browser, with some limitations.

![](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/select-agent-for-requests.gif)

> If you try to send a request and it isn't successful because the agent isn't selected, you will see a link in the response area that you can select to switch to the agent and try your request again.

#### Web limitations

Postman for Web is under active development. There are a few features you can currently only access in the desktop app, not in your browser:

* <u>Find and replace</u>: The Postman desktop app supports finding and replacing values in a workspace, but this function isn't available on Postman for Web yet.
* <u>Certificates and proxy</u>: The Postman desktop app enables you to customize certificates and proxy configurations. On Postman for Web, these take the browser defined value and can't be overridden by Postman.
* <u>Postman Interceptor</u>: Interceptor syncs cookies from your browser to the Postman desktop app and captures network requests directly from the browser. It's not possible to use Interceptor with Postman for Web.

### Updating Postman

The native Postman apps will notify you when a major update is available. For other updates you will see a dot on the settings icon. If the indicator is red instead of orange, it indicates a failed update.

![](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/update-ready-v86.jpg)

Select the update option to download or install the latest update. You will see a notification when the download is complete, prompting you to restart the Postman app to apply the updates. If you don't want to update yet, choose <u>Later</u> to auto-update the next time you launch the app.

You can configure your preferences to enable automatic download for major updates in <u>Settings > Update</u>. Postman automatically downloads minor updates and bug fixes.

![](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/settings-updates-v9.jpg)

### Using Postman behind a firewall

Postman's infrastructure runs on Amazon's AWS platform. If you are operating behind a network firewall, you will need to allow the following domains to make WebSocket connections for Postman:

* `\*getpostman.com`
* `\*.postman.co`
* `\*.pstmn.io`
* `\*postman.com`

By default, WebSocket connections use the same ports as HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443).

Postman doesn't have a fixed IP range that can be provided. If necessary, please refer to the [current AWS IP ranges](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-ip-ranges.html) and allows the broad range provided.

### Troubleshooting your Postman installation

If you encounter any issues installing and running Postman, check out the following tips. If these don't help, please refer to the installation posts on the community forum and create a new post if your issue isn't already covered.

#### Update failed error

If you see and <u>Update Failed</u> notification in Postman, you can use the DevTools to investigate.

![](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/update-error-dialog.png)

Open the DevTools using <u>View > Developer > Show DevTools(Current View)</u>.

Some known errors are as follows:

* Error message:`Cannot update while running on a read-only volume`
  * This error that the app user doesn't have write permission in the directory where Postman is installed. To resolve the problem, move Postman to a directory where the user has write permissions, for example the `/Application` directory for Mac, and to the `home` directory for Linux.
* Error message:`Code signature at URL file:///... did not pass validation: code object is not signed at all`
  * This error means that there are multiple updates running at the same time. This can happen when the app is opened before the previous update could finish. To resolve the problem, quit and reopen the app.
* Error message:`EACCES: permission denied, open '/opt/Postman/Postman-1620288011421.tar.gz'`
  * This error means that the app user doesn't have write permission in the directory where Postman is installed. To resolve the problem, move Postman to a directory where the user has write permissions, for example the `home` directory for Linux.

#### Update button not available

If you are using Postman for Linux, and installed the app with the Ubuntu Software Center or Snap Store, you may not see a <u>Check for updates</u> button. This is because the updates are handled by the store, which should automatically update Postman on a regular cadence[^1-1].
