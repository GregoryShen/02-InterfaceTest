## [Installing and Updating](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/installation-and-updates/)

Postman is available on the web at [go.postman.co/home](https://go.postman.co/home) and as a native desktop app for Mac(Intel and M1), Windows (32-bit/64-bit), and Linux (64-bit) operating systems.

To get the latest version of the Postman desktop app, visit the download page and select Download for your platform.

### Installing Postman on the desktop

#### Mac

Postman is available for macOS 10.11(EI Capitan) and later.

1. Download the latest Postman app.

   Make sure to download the Mac Apple Chip version if you have a Mac with the M1 processor.

2. If your browser downloads the file as a ZIP file, find the file in the Downloads folder and unzip it.

3. In the Downloads folders, double-click the Postman file to install it.

4. When prompted, move the file to your Applications folder. This will ensure that future updates can be installed correctly.

You may encounter a "Library not loaded" error if you unzip and install Postman using a third-party archiving app. Use the default Archive Utility for Mac to unzip the file.

You can also install Postman using the Homebrew package manager:

```shell
brew install --cask postman
```

#### Windows

Postman is available for Windows 7 and later.

1. Download the latest Postman app.
2. Select and run the `.exe` file to install Postman.

Postman v9.4 is the latest version of the Postman app that supports both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows. All versions of the Postman app following v9.4 will only work on 64-bit Windows. You can continue to use Postman v9.4 and earlier on 32-bit Windows.

#### Linux

You can install Postman on Linux by manually downloading it, using the [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/postman) store link, or with the command `snap install postman`.

To install manually, download and unzip the app, for example into the `Downloads` directory.

To start the app from a launcher icon, create a desktop file, naming it `Postman.desktop` and saving it in the following location:

```bash
~/.local/share/applications/Postman.desktop
```

Enter the following content in the file, replacing `/path/to/Downloads` with the location of the file, and save it.

```shell
[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Name=Postman
Exec=/path/to/Downloads/Postman/app/Postman %U
Icon=/path/to/Downloads/Postman/app/resources/app/assets/icon.png
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=Development;
```

Postman supports the following distributions:

* Ubuntu 14.04 and newer
* Fedora 24
* Debian 8 and newer

The support of certain Linux distributions depends on if they're supported by Electron. Refer to [Electron's documentation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/support#linux).

It's recommended you install Snap as it includes all the libraries that the app needs and they're bundled with the app itself.

Avoid starting Postman using the `sudo` command, as it will create permission issues on the files created by Postman.

Make sure you have read/write permission for the `~/.config` folder where Postman stores information.

If you are an Ubuntu 18 user, you will also need to install the `ligbconf-2-4` package with the command `apt-get install libgconf-2-4`

### Using Postman on the web

You can use Postman in your web browser to carry out your API development and testing tasks in conjunction with the Postman Agent. To access Postman for Web, visit go.postman.co/home. 

#### Browser requirements

Postman for Web is optimized for the following browsers:

* Chrome(78 and higher)
* Firefox(76 and higher)
* Edge(70 and higher)
* Safari(13.1.1 and higher)

#### Installing the Postman desktop agent

If you are using the Postman for Web, you also need to download the Postman desktop agent, a micro-application that runs locally on your desktop. The desktop agent overcomes the Cross Object Resources Sharing(CORS) limitations of browsers and acts as your agent for making API calls from Postman for Web.

You will be prompted to download and install the desktop agent so that you can make requests from Postman for Web. You can also download the agent directly from the Postman Agent page. Once you have the desktop agent installed you will be able to use it with web requests.

To learn more about the desktop agent, read the [Introducing the Postman Agent](https://blog.postman.com/introducing-the-postman-agent-send-api-requests-from-your-browser-without-limits/) blog post.

#### Selecting the agent for requests

From Postman for Web, you can select the agent you would like to use for your requests:

* <u>Auto-select</u>: Postman automatically selects the best agent to use for your request.
* <u>Cloud</u>: Manually select this option to send HTTP requests using Postman's cloud servers.
* <u>Desktop</u>: Manually select this option to send requests using the Postman desktop agent.
* <u>Browser</u>: Manually select this option to send requests using your browser, with some limitations.

![](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/select-agent-for-requests.gif)

> If you try to send a request and it isn't successful because the agent isn't selected, you will see a link in the response area that you can select to switch to the agent and try your request again.

#### Web limitations

Postman for Web is under active development. There are a few features you can currently only access in the desktop app, not in your browser:

* <u>Find and replace</u>: The Postman desktop app supports finding and replacing values in a workspace, but this function isn't available on Postman for Web yet.
* <u>Certificates and proxy</u>: The Postman desktop app enables you to customize certificates and proxy configurations. On Postman for Web, these take the browser defined value and can't be overridden by Postman.
* <u>Postman Interceptor</u>: Interceptor syncs cookies from your browser to the Postman desktop app and captures network requests directly from the browser. It's not possible to use Interceptor with Postman for Web.

### Updating Postman

The native Postman apps will notify you when a major update is available. For other updates you will see a dot on the settings icon. If the indicator is red instead of orange, it indicates a failed update.

![](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/update-ready-v86.jpg)

Select the update option to download or install the latest update. You will see a notification when the download is complete, prompting you to restart the Postman app to apply the updates. If you don't want to update yet, choose <u>Later</u> to auto-update the next time you launch the app.

You can configure your preferences to enable automatic download for major updates in <u>Settings > Update</u>. Postman automatically downloads minor updates and bug fixes.

![](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/settings-updates-v9.jpg)

### Using Postman behind a firewall

Postman's infrastructure runs on Amazon's AWS platform. If you are operating behind a network firewall, you will need to allow the following domains to make WebSocket connections for Postman:

* `\*getpostman.com`
* `\*.postman.co`
* `\*.pstmn.io`
* `\*postman.com`

By default, WebSocket connections use the same ports as HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443).

Postman doesn't have a fixed IP range that can be provided. If necessary, please refer to the [current AWS IP ranges](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-ip-ranges.html) and allows the broad range provided.

### Troubleshooting your Postman installation

If you encounter any issues installing and running Postman, check out the following tips. If these don't help, please refer to the installation posts on the community forum and create a new post if your issue isn't already covered.

#### Update failed error

If you see and <u>Update Failed</u> notification in Postman, you can use the DevTools to investigate.

![](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/update-error-dialog.png)

Open the DevTools using <u>View > Developer > Show DevTools(Current View)</u>.

Some known errors are as follows:

* Error message:`Cannot update while running on a read-only volume`
  * This error that the app user doesn't have write permission in the directory where Postman is installed. To resolve the problem, move Postman to a directory where the user has write permissions, for example the `/Application` directory for Mac, and to the `home` directory for Linux.
* Error message:`Code signature at URL file:///... did not pass validation: code object is not signed at all`
  * This error means that there are multiple updates running at the same time. This can happen when the app is opened before the previous update could finish. To resolve the problem, quit and reopen the app.
* Error message:`EACCES: permission denied, open '/opt/Postman/Postman-1620288011421.tar.gz'`
  * This error means that the app user doesn't have write permission in the directory where Postman is installed. To resolve the problem, move Postman to a directory where the user has write permissions, for example the `home` directory for Linux.

#### Update button not available

If you are using Postman for Linux, and installed the app with the Ubuntu Software Center or Snap Store, you may not see a <u>Check for updates</u> button. This is because the updates are handled by the store, which should automatically update Postman on a regular cadence[^1-1].

## [Navigating Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/navigating-postman/)

Postman provides a variety of views and controls to manage your API projects.

![](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/app-overview-v9.5.jpg)

The Postman UI includes the following components:

* The left sidebar provides access to your collections, APIs, environments, mock servers, monitors, and request history.
* The header allows you to create workspaces, access reports, explore the public API network, search within Postman, view sync status and notifications, move and invite collaborators to workspaces, capture requests and cookies, and access your settings, account, and Postman plan.
* The center area is where you build and work with requests.
* The status bar along the bottom allows you to show/hide the sidebar, find and replace, and open the console on the left. On the right, you can launch the Bootcamp, collections runner, trash, and two pane view, as well as access help resources.

On the right panel, you can see icons to view the documentation, comments, code, and request info.

![](http://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/right-panel-view-v8.jpg)

To open the <u>Documentation</u> tab, select the request under your collection and select the Documentation icon on the right panel.

![](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/overview-documentations-v8.jpg)

To open the documentation in another tab, select <u>View complete collection documentation</u>.

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/documentation-pane-v8.jpg"  />

To publish a documentation for a collection, see [Publishing your documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/publishing-your-api/publishing-your-docs/).

To open the <u>Comments</u> tab, select the request under your collection and the Comments icon on the right panel. You can switch to comment mode to leave comments on a specific part of the request, including parameters, headers, body, and tests.

![](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/overview-comments-v8.jpg)

To learn more about comments, see [Commenting on collections](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/commenting-on-collections/).

To open the <u>Code snippets[^1-2]</u> tab, select the request under your collection, and then select the Cod icon `</>`  on the right panel. For more information, see [Generating code snippets](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/generate-code-snippets/).

<img src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/code-snippet-pane-v8.jpg"  />

### Resizing and collapsing panes

You can drag the bottom panel to resize the panes in the Postman UI.

![](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/panes-resized-v8.gif)

You can also declutter[^1-3] your workspace by collapsing panes. Use the button at the bottom-left to hide the sidebar and the button at the bottom-right to toggle between a single and two pane view.

![](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/split-pane-view-v8.jpg)

### Related Collections

When a request is selected in Postman, you can see a Related Collections (light bulb) icon :bulb: on the right panel.

Select the icon to view public collections from the [API Network](https://www.postman.com/explore/) that share the same base URL as your request and include API documentation to help you get started.

![](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/collection-rec-v8.8.0.jpg)

You can select any recommended collection to view its contents and documentation. You can also directly fork a recommended collection to quick-start your development.

### Universal search

You can access universal search by selecting <u>Search Postman</u> at the top of Postman, or by using the keyboard shortcut `Command+K`.

Enter your search string and change the scope of search to narrow down your search results to all of Postman, your personal or team space, or the Public API Network. You can also change the scope of your search to Workspaces, Collections, APIs, or Teams.

![](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/change-scope-for-universal-search-v9.5.jpg)

> For signed-in users, the default search scope on workspaces is Team. On explore, the default is Public API Network. For signed-out users, the results only include public resources and don't contain private data.

If you don't find what you are looking for in the list of results, select Search all workspaces, collections, APIs and teams and you can find all the results in one page.

![](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/search-all-workspaces-collections-and-teams-v9.5.jpg)

The left navigation on the <u>Search results</u> page lists the scope and entity type. You can change these options to further filter your results.

![](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/universal-search-results-page-v8.jpg)

You can sort results using <u>Sort by</u> on the right by selecting *Most relevant*(default), *Most views*, or *Most recent*.

![](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/search-result-sort-by-v8.jpg)

Depending on the entity type, the search results contain different information:

* For workspaces, the search result contains the workspace type, summary, who published it, and when was it published.
* For collections, the search result contains the workspace type, whether the collection is a fork or not, who published it, and when was it published.
* For APIs, the search result contains the name and summary of the API, the API's owner (either an individual user or a team), and the type of workspace.
* For teams, the search result contains the name and summary of the team. Selecting the team name redirects you to the team profile.

### Find and replace

In the Postman app, you can search the current workspace by selecting <u>Find and Replace</u> in the status bar at the bottom left, or by entering <u>Command+Shift+F</u> or <u>Ctrl+Shift+F</u>.

Enter your search string and, optionally, choose which entities to return, entering replacement text if necessary.

![](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/find-and-replace-tab-v8.jpg)

Postman searches tabs, collections, and variables. You can select an item directly in the search results to open an entity.

> <u>Find and Replace</u> isn't available in Postman for Web.

### History

You can access a history of the requests you've made in the <u>History</u> tab on the left. If you're signed into a Postman account, your history syncs across your devices.

![](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/history-request-v8.jpg)

Select a request to open it again. Select + to save the request to a collection. Toggle <u>Save Responses</u> to save request responses so that you can view what returned by a request when you open it from your history.

The history also includes the collection runs executed. These remain as the summarized version of the run and aren't logged as single requests. The <u>Save Responses</u> option can't be used with requests from collection runner.

The <u>View more actions</u> menu allows you to save, monitor, document, or mock a request. Use the delete (trash icon) or <u>Clear all</u> options to remove requests from your history. You can select multiple requests by pressing `Command` or `Ctrl` and selecting the requests.

### Tabs

Tabs allow you to organize and work between multiple requests.

#### Opening a new tab

To open a new tab, select `+` in the middle of the screen.

> Keyboard shortcut: You can also select `Command + T` or `Ctrl + T` on your keyboard to open a new tab.

![](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/open-new-tab.jpg)

If you open a request and don't edit or send it, then open another request, the second tab replaces the first tab. When the tab is in preview mode, it displays in italics.

You can set whether Postman opens requests in new tabs. Select the gear icon :gear: to open <u>Settings</u>. Under <u>Requests</u>, use the toggle next to <u>Always open requests in a new tab</u> to turn this option on or off.

#### Managing tabs

You can have many tabs open at the same time. To rearrange your open tabs, select and drag them in the desired order.

To manage your open tabs or to access recently closed tabs, select the three dots to open a menu with action options:

* <u>Recently Closed Tabs</u>: Shows you tabs that you closed recently. Select one to reopen it.
* <u>Duplicate Selected Tab</u>: (*Desktop app only*) Duplicates the current tab. This does not create a copy of the request, so when you duplicate a tab any edits you make are reflected in the original request.
* <u>Close Selected Tab</u>: Closes the current tab. If the tab contains unsaved changes, Postman will ask if you want to save before closing.
* <u>Force Close Selected Tab</u>: Closes the current tab without saving any changes.
* <u>Close All but Selected Tab</u>: Closes all tabs except the one you are currently working in.
* <u>Close All Tabs</u>: Closes all tabs. If any tabs contain unsaved changes, Postman will ask if you want to save before closing.
* <u>Force Close All Tabs</u>: Closes all tabs without saving any changes.

![](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/manage-tabs.jpg)

You can also manage your open tabs or open a new tab by right-clicking on an existing tab:

* <u>New Request</u>: (*Postman for Web only*) Opens a new tab.
* <u>Duplicate Tab</u>: (*Desktop app only*) Duplicates the current tab. This does not create a copy of the request, so when you duplicate a tab any edits you make are reflected in the original request.
* <u>Close Tab</u>: Closes the current tab. If the tab contains unsaved changes, Postman will ask if you want to save before closing.
* <u>Force Close Tab</u>: Closes the current tab without saving any changes.
* <u>Close All tabs</u>: Closes all tabs. If any tabs contain unsaved changes, Postman will ask if you want to save before closing.
* <u>Force Close All Tabs</u>: Closes all tabs without saving any changes.

![](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/right-click-manage-tab.jpg)

> <u>Closing unsaved tabs</u>: You can set whether Postman asks whether you want to save when you close a tab that contains changes. Select the gear icon :gear: to open <u>Settings</u>. Under <u>Requests</u>, use the toggle next to <u>Always ask when closing unsaved tabs</u> to turn this option on or off.

If you have a lot of tabs open, they might overflow the area of the tab bar. To navigate to tabs that are outside he viewable area, select the arrows to the left or right of the tab bar.

![](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/tab-navigation-scroll.jpg)

#### Saving or discarding changes

If a tab has unsaved changes, Postman displays a dot next to the tab name. Select :floppy_disk: <u>Save</u> to save the changes. To discard the changes, select the close icon X to close the tab, then select <u>Don't save</u>.

#### Viewing conflicts

A tab may indicate a conflict if you or a collaborator changes it in another tab or workspace. Postman prompts you to resolve any conflicts that may occur.

![](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/tab-conflict.jpg)

### Next steps

The best way to get to know Postman is by firing up the <u>Bootcamp</u> on the bottom-right and working through the lessons.

![](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/bootcamp-lesson-v8.gif)

To find more resources to get started with Postman, select <u>Home</u> in the upper-left corner.
